"""bartorch.core.graph — Operation dispatch via the C++ extension.

``dispatch(op_name, inputs, output_dims, **kwargs)`` is the single entry point
used by every op in ``bartorch.tools``.

bartorch requires the compiled C++ extension ``_bartorch_ext``.  The extension
embeds BART and links to the BLAS and FFT libraries bundled with PyTorch — no
external ``bart`` binary is needed, and no data is ever written to ``/dev/shm``
or disk.

If the extension is not available a clear :exc:`ImportError` is raised with
installation instructions.

Normalisation (complex64 cast, numpy → tensor) is performed upstream by the
:func:`~bartorch.core.tensor.bart_op` decorator applied to every op function.
By the time ``dispatch`` is called all array inputs are guaranteed to be
``torch.complex64`` tensors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    op_name:
        BART tool name (e.g. ``"fft"``).
    inputs:
        Positional array inputs.  Must be ``torch.complex64`` tensors —

    output_dims:
        Expected output shape, or ``None`` to infer at runtime.
    **kwargs:
        Flag / scalar arguments forwarded to the BART command string.
        Boolean ``True`` values produce bare flags; numeric or string values
        produce flag-value pairs.  ``None`` and ``False`` are ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor or tuple of torch.Tensor
        Operation result(s) as plain ``complex64`` tensors in C-order.
